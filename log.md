# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about the 100 Days of Code challenge, then reviewed my progress on Freecodecamp and some doodles I did with JavaScript using Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Recommitting takes time. I expect rust, but hopefully the payoff of understanding JavaScript better is worth it.

### Day 1: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript30 curriculum, learned about keyboard keyCodes, and how to isolate keys using functions  to get the desired output. I'm halfway through the JavaScript Drum Kit exercise.

**Thoughts** Until now, I hadn't experimented with sound files (.wav) at all. I didn't expect it to be so intricate, but once I got the hang of it, things went smoothly from there.

### Day 2: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I brushed up on JS algorithm scripting over at Freecodecamp, then read through the first chapter of Eloquent JS, focusing on logical operators.

**Thoughts** It's good to unplug from purely coding for hours at a time to read about how things are supposed to work.

### Day 3: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I set up an account on Codewars, then revived my account over at Codingame. Curiosity about programming video games initially piqued my interest re: coding. 

**Thoughts** Games are fun. At times, coding feels like getting a root canal while tapdancing on hot coals. Using a game environment to refine my skills is more stimulating than watching error messages flash across the screen.

### Day 4: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I read through the second chapter of Eloquent JS, which focuses on program structure and how to construct clean, proper code when writing programs.

**Thoughts** There's truth to the old saying that the easiest solution is often the simplest. The less code involved when writing a program, the better. Less can go wrong. Fewer of those nasty error messages too.

### Day 5, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I read through the third chapter of Eloquent JS, which focuses on functions. Then I went fished out my old coding binder and went over some of the basic functions I constructed in the past, such as converting Celsius to Farenheit and back again.

**Thoughts** A lot of revision today.

### Day 6, January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I revived my Khan Academy account and revisited my Math and HTML progress. 

**Thoughts** Khan Academy is a great environment, and one I wish I hadn't forgotten about.

### Day 7, January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more of the Khan Academy HTML and CSS curriculum.

**Thoughts** It's easier to digest how to apply CSS once I've had a long look at the source code of other simple sites, such as portfolio pages. Definitely looking to apply it to some ideas that I'm mulling over.

### Day 8, January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did more math and CSS stuff over at Khan Academy before I headed over to my Codepen account to brush up on my grasp of Bootstrap. 

**Thoughts** The carousel is perfect for a rudimentary profile page, so I'll probably include it in my final design when I tackle it.

### Day 9, January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I read through the fourth chapter of Eloquent JS, which focuses on data structures, objects, and arrays.

**Thoughts**

### Day 10, January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fiddled around with some ideas for the Portfolio Profile Page, and did some reading about CSS. Background images that take up the entire page are definitely my style.

### Day 11, January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Found an article outlining CSS Selectors. Solid read, and I fiddled around with some of them.

**Thoughts** CSS can be intimidating. Especially if you're not accustomed to the selectors that can conflict with each other.

### Day 12, January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Plugging through my old notes on the JS canvas, and I found an introductory article on it.

**Thoughts** It's a quick, good read on making shapes. Rudimentary stuff, but I'd rather get the syntax perfect by reviewing it until it sticks permanently.

### Day 13, January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Taking a deeper look at Data Analysis, I'm concentrating on how to construct graphs and charts, specifically Pie Charts.

**Thoughts** Bar Graphs are pretty straightforward, but pie charts are a pain. I had no idea there was so much that could go awry. I don't have anything polished to show for my efforts just yet, but I'll definitely try to have something up on my Codepen by tomorrow. Anything to preoccupy myself from Trump's inauguration.

### Day 14, January 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I re-visited my account at Code.org and worked through the programming courses.

**Thoughts** The Star Wars twist on Hour of Code is interesting, and I like the progressively challenging courses that they offer. I cobbled a game together too.

### Day 15, January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through the 5th chapter of Eloquent JS, which encompasses Higher-Order Functions.

**Thoughts** The computer almost died on me, so instead of punching out lines of code, I wrote them out by hand.

### Day 16, January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Switched between Khan Academy and code.org to get some coding and math done. I don't have a project to show for it, but the environment provides solid challenges and tutorial videos.

**Thoughts** The connection between math and coding will always feel eerie to me. Once you've got the hang of it, its smooth sailing, but I definitely understand why functions like Math.random() can seem daunting. So much can go wrong in a hurry.

### Day 17, January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started transferring some of my freeCodeCamp Bonfire challenges onto a separate repository, and even found some mistakes in my original notes. 

**Thoughts** Finding errors in my old code was embarassing, but I would much rather learn from it than hitch it out of sight.

### Day 18, January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today was a reading day, and I outlined a bunch of things that I'm going to use to make my profile portfolio page. 

**Thoughts**

### Day 19, January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I added more of the Bonfire Challenges. And found even mistakes than before.

**Thoughts** It was also Mental Health Awareness day, a solid initiative that deserves far more attention and funding than it currently gets. #BellLetsTalk

### Day 20, January 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tackled two more Bonfire Challenges. The first involved truncating a string which resulted in me discovering that I had nothing on Ternary Operators (? :) in my notes. The second involved splitting an array in half, then pushing the resulting values into separate arrays altogether.

**Thoughts** A Ternary Operator is a good shortcut when dealing with conditionals. I'll definitely be looking to use them more going forward.
