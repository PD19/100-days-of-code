# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about the 100 Days of Code challenge, then reviewed my progress on Freecodecamp and some doodles I did with JavaScript using Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Recommitting takes time. I expect rust, but hopefully the payoff of understanding JavaScript better is worth it.
