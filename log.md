# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about the 100 Days of Code challenge, then reviewed my progress on Freecodecamp and some doodles I did with JavaScript using Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Recommitting takes time. I expect rust, but hopefully the payoff of understanding JavaScript better is worth it.

### Day 1: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript30 curriculum, learned about keyboard keyCodes, and how to isolate keys using functions  to get the desired output. I'm halfway through the JavaScript Drum Kit exercise.

**Thoughts** Until now, I hadn't experimented with sound files (.wav) at all. I didn't expect it to be so intricate, but once I got the hang of it, things went smoothly from there.

### Day 2: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I brushed up on JS algorithm scripting over at Freecodecamp, then read through the first chapter of Eloquent JS, focusing on logical operators.

**Thoughts** It's good to unplug from purely coding for hours at a time to read about how things are supposed to work.

### Day 3: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I set up an account on Codewars, then revived my account over at Codingame. Curiosity about programming video games initially piqued my interest re: coding. 

**Thoughts** Games are fun. At times, coding feels like getting a root canal while tapdancing on hot coals. Using a game environment to refine my skills is more stimulating than watching error messages flash across the screen.

### Day 4: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I read through the second chapter of Eloquent JS, which focuses on program structure and how to construct clean, proper code when writing programs.

**Thoughts** There's truth to the old saying that the easiest solution is often the simplest. The less code involved when writing a program, the better. Less can go wrong. Fewer of those nasty error messages too.

### Day 5, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I read through the third chapter of Eloquent JS, which focuses on functions. Then I went fished out my old coding binder and went over some of the basic functions I constructed in the past, such as converting Celsius to Farenheit and back again.

**Thoughts**
