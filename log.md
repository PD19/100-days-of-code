# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read about the 100 Days of Code challenge, then reviewed my progress on Freecodecamp and some doodles I did with JavaScript using Canvas.

**Thoughts:** Recommitting takes time. I expect rust, but hopefully the payoff of understanding JavaScript better is worth it.

### Day 1: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the JavaScript30 curriculum, learned about keyboard keyCodes, and how to isolate keys using functions  to get the desired output. I'm halfway through the JavaScript Drum Kit exercise.

**Thoughts** Until now, I hadn't experimented with sound files (.wav) at all. I didn't expect it to be so intricate, but once I got the hang of it, things went smoothly from there.
